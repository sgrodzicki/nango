## API gotchas

- Avalara uses BASIC auth mode to access various AvaTax API endpoints. You can provide either a combination of your `username` and `password` or your `accountID` and `licensekey` to authenticate with the Avalara AvaTax API. The license key can be generated by an account administrator under Settings > Reset License Key.
- When creating a new connection on Nango, please provide the `avalaraClient`, which can help you diagnose and resolve issues with your software when used appropriately. This value is a combination of `(app name); (app version); (library name); (library version); (machine name)`. For more details, refer to [Client Headers](https://developer.avalara.com/avatax/client-headers/)
